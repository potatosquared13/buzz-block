1) write client identity to nfc
    Client c = new Client(new File("path/to/client.key"));
    byte[] stuffToWriteToNfc = Helper.hexToBytes(c.getIdentity());
    then write stuffToWriteToNfc to the nfc tag
    Preferably make a button for this, so you can test it in the app with any client file

2) create node object in the main application loop or something and make it start listening for connections
basta the node object should be available in the entire application because it has to stay alive for the networking shit
You'll need to add android.permission.INTERNET as a permission just like you did with NFC
    Node n = new Node(new File("path/to/client.key"));
    n.start();
    That starts two threads that start network sockets for listening
    THEN AFTER THAT you should be running your main application stuffs
    i don't know where you should put it

3) buttons for send transaction/get balance
    in the code that gets called when you press the buttons:
    read the nfc tag so you have the byte[] of the identity, then:
        byte[] byteArrayFromNfc = read the nfc tag
        String sender = Helper.bytesToHex(byteArrayFromNfc);
        double amount = make the user enter an amount to be put here
        n.send_transaction(sender, amount);
        or
        n.getBalance(sender);
    respectively, for send transaction and get balance


and i think that's it kbye
